# **1\. Python Syntax:**

* Learn about indentation, which is crucial in Python, as it determines the structure of your code.
    
* Understand how to use colons and proper spacing in Python statements and code blocks.

# **2\. Python Comments:**

* Explore the importance of comments in your code. Comments provide explanations and make your code more readable.
    
* Practice adding single-line comments (#) and multi-line comments (''' or" ").

# **3\. Python Variables:**

* Learn about variables, which are used to store data in Python. Understand variable naming rules, including valid characters and conventions like snake\_case.
    
* Create variables to store different types of data, such as numbers, text, and more.

# **5\. Python Numbers:**

* Explore numerical data in Python. Learn about integers and floating-point numbers, and how Python handles mathematical operations.
    
* Practice performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Python.
    

%[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp] 

# **6\. Hands-On Exercises:**

* Apply what you've learned today by solving Python coding exercises related to syntax, comments, variables, data types, and numbers. Websites like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codecademy offer Python exercises for practice.
    

## Solve the following problems:

* **Area of a Rectangle:** Write a program that calculates and prints the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width as input.
    
* **Area of a Circle:** Write a program that calculates and prints the area of a circle. Get the radius as input from the user.
    

For each of these problems, start by defining the problem, taking user input (if applicable), performing the required mathematical operations, and then displaying the result. These exercises will help you practice Python's arithmetic operations and strengthen your problem-solving skills.
