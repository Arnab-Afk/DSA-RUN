# **1\. Working with Strings:**

* Begin your day by exploring strings in Python. Learn how to create strings, use single and double quotes, and escape characters.
    
* Practice string concatenation and slicing (accessing parts of a string).

# **2\. Boolean and Comparison Operators:**

* Understand boolean data types, which represent True or False values. Learn about comparison operators (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=) used to compare values.
    
* Experiment with conditional statements using booleans and comparison operators.

# **3\. Logical Operators:**

* Dive into logical operators (and, or, not) in Python. These operators are used to combine boolean values and make more complex conditions.
    
* Work on examples that demonstrate the use of logical operators in decision-making.

# **4\. Lists:**

* Learn about lists, a versatile data structure in Python that can hold a collection of items. Explore how to create, access, append, insert, and remove elements from lists.
    
* Practice list manipulation and understand list indexing and slicing.
    

```python
sea_creatures = ['shark', 'cuttlefish', 'squid', 'mantis shrimp', 'anemone']
print(sea_creatures)
```

# **5\. Tuples:**

* Explore tuples, which are similar to lists but immutable (cannot be modified after creation). Learn how to create tuples and access their elements.
    
* Understand when and why to use tuples instead of lists.
    

%[https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp] 

```python
#Example Tuple
coral = ('blue coral', 'staghorn coral', 'pillar coral', 'elkhorn coral')
print(coral)
```

# **6\. Practical Exercises:**

* Apply your knowledge by working on practical exercises that involve strings, booleans, operators, lists, and tuples. These exercises can include tasks like searching for a specific word in a string, evaluating boolean expressions, or working with lists and tuples to solve problems.
    

## Solve The Following Problems:

**Age Comparison:** Ask the user for their age and compare it to a predefined legal drinking age. Print whether the user is old enough to drink.

**Password Checker:** Prompt the user to set a password and then ask them to enter it again. Compare the two inputs and print whether they match.

**List Operations:** Define a list of your favorite fruits. Write a program that asks the user to add a new fruit to the list, remove a fruit, and display the updated list.

**Coordinates:** Create a program that asks the user for the coordinates (x, y) of a point. Store these coordinates in a tuple and print them.

**Temperature Record:** Define a tuple containing temperature readings for a week. Calculate and print the average temperature for the week.
